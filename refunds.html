    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Refund Policy applies to all consulting, advisory, and implementation services
      provided by Online Distributions.
    </p>

    <h2>Consulting & Advisory Services</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of consulting and advisory services — which involve time-based access,
      customized analysis, and strategic guidance — all payments are non-refundable once services
      have begun.
    </p>

    <h2>Distribution Diagnostic</h2>
    <p>
      The Distribution Diagnostic includes a scheduled 1:1 session and a customized assessment.
      Once the session has been delivered or the assessment work has started, the fee is non-refundable.
    </p>

    <h2>Build & Launch and Done-For-You Services</h2>
    <p>
      Project-based and implementation services involve upfront planning, allocation of resources,
      and reserved capacity. As a result, payments for these services are non-refundable once work
      has commenced.
    </p>

    <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
    <p>
      Refund requests may be considered on a case-by-case basis prior to service delivery.
      Any approved refund is issued at the sole discretion of Online Distributions.
    </p>
