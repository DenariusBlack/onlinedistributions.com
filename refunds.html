    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Refund Policy applies to all consulting, advisory, and implementation
      services provided by Online Distributions.
    </p>

    <h2>Consulting & Advisory Services</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of consulting and advisory services, which involve
      time-based access and customized analysis, all payments are non-refundable
      once services have begun.
    </p>

    <h2>Distribution Diagnostic</h2>
    <p>
      The Distribution Diagnostic includes a scheduled session and customized
      assessment. Once the session has been delivered or preparation has started,
      the fee is non-refundable.
    </p>

    <h2>Build & Launch / Done-For-You Services</h2>
    <p>
      Project-based and implementation services require reserved capacity and
      upfront planning. Payments are non-refundable once work has commenced.
    </p>

    <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
    <p>
      Refund requests submitted before service delivery may be reviewed on a
      case-by-case basis at our sole discretion.
    </p>
